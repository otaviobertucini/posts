- SQL is declarative, meaning we donâ€™t tell the database how to do something. Rather, we give the result or the pattern that we are looking for
	- It hides implementation details of the database engine
	- So a given query can be executed differently depending on the context it is being executed (indexes, size of table, foreign key)
	- It also an advantage in parallel jobs, where a same query can be executed in different ways
- CSS is another example of declarative languages
