# Testing

- Headless browser: faster
- Puppeteer returns a browser instance to JS
    - The browser instance let’s us create tabs and manipulate them
- The test suite and the browser are executed in two different threads.
    - This means they cannot communicate directly
    - What puppeteer does is to serialize all commands in the test suite into text and send it to the browser
    - The browser then executes the command and send result back to the test suite in text too

- One of the challenges of browser testing is OAuth authentication. Once we run our tests in remote machines, Google will ask for the user to answer for CAPTCHAs.
    - So, we should “skip” the authentication by normal methods (using the interface)
    - Changing the codebase so test can pass is a bad practice
